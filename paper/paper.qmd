title: "Do Women Politicians Face More Interruptions? An Analysis of Interjections in the Australian Parliamentary Debates (1998-2025)"
abstract: "Interruptions are a routine component of parliamentary debate, but also reveal underlying power dynamics and behavioural norms within political institutions. Using a dataset of digitized Australian Hansard transcripts from 1998 to 2025, this paper examines the frequency of interruptions in the House of Representatives debates, focusing on the effects of gender and political party affiliation. Our analysis shows that women Members of Parliament (MPs) and MPs from centre and centre-right leaning parties are less likely to be interrupted, and that the overall frequency of interruptions declined as the number of women in parliament increased. These findings provide new empirical evidence on the relationship between institutional norms and representation, demonstrating how quantitative analysis of parliamentary speech can detect subtle, gendered patterns of discursive inequality over time."

# Introduction

Women are increasingly being elected to parliaments around the world, including in Australia. Despite gains in numerical representation, women remain underrepresented in a substantive sense, because their ability to influence political debates and shape policy outcomes is often constrained. @pitkin1967 distinguishes between these two forms of representation as *descriptive* and *substantive*. Descriptive representation refers to the presence of women in elected office, while substantive representation involves speaking and acting on behalf of women's interests, including introducing legislation, engaging in debates, or undertaking advocacy efforts [@mccallion2024].

Increases in women's descriptive representation do not automatically lead to stronger substantive representation. Feminist institutionalist scholars argue that political institutions are gendered in ways that constrain women's political influence [@tremblay2003; @sawer2012; @kenny2014]. Formal and informal rules, norms, and hierarchies within institutions can subtly, yet powerfully limit women's ability to engage in substantive representation. One such behaviour is the use of interruptions during parliamentary proceedings. Interruptions are defined as "intrusions into the current speaker's turn" [@kollock1985, p. 38]. Although interruptions are a routine and institutionally sanctioned feature of parliamentary debate, they can be employed particularly by men MPs to assert dominance, undermine, or silence women MPs [@vallejo2022]. As @och2020 argues, such interruptions can be a form of resistance to women's substantive representation, reinforcing gendered power dynamics within parliament.

Following calls by @celis2008 [p. 99] to rethink substantive representation along the lines of "where, how, and why" does it occur, this paper emphasizes the "who" and "how." Specifically, we examine who is interrupted, focusing on the gender and political party affiliation of the Members of Parliament (MPs) and how interruptions can operate as a gendered constraint on substantive representation in the Australian House of Representatives. Our paper asks: do women MPs get interrupted more than men MPs? Does political party affiliation shape which MPs get interrupted the most? <!--How does the issue being discussed impact the likelihood or nature of interruptions?-->

To answer these questions, we analyze a dataset of digitized Hansard transcripts from the 39th to 47th parliaments (November 1998 to March 2025) [@katz2025]. Through quantitative analysis of parliamentary debates and Question Time (QT), we examine the frequency and nature of interruptions along gendered and party lines. Our findings reveal that women MPs are less likely to be interrupted than men MPs, when controlling for the number of speeches each MP gives in each parliament. We also found that when compared to the Australian Labor Party, MPs affiliated with the Liberal Party of Australia, The Nationals, and the Australian Greens were less likely to be interrupted. Our results highlight that parliamentary and temporal contexts shape the frequency of interruptions, with the 39th and 40th parliaments seeing more interruptions overall than recent parliaments (46th and 47th). These results suggest that increasing the descriptive representation of women is slowly beginning to change institutional norms and contexts. 

This paper contributes to a small, but growing body of quantitative research analyzing the substantive representation of women in Australian politics [@vacaflores2025; @vandijk2025]. By combining feminist institutional analysis with quantitative methods, we show how institutional constraints like interruptions undermine women's substantive representation.

This paper proceeds as follows. We begin by outlining our theoretical frameworks, including women's substantive representation, feminist institutionalism, and gendered parliamentary discourse. We then discuss our data and methodology, followed by analysis of our results. Finally, we conclude by summarizing our main findings, highlighting our contributions, and suggesting areas for future research.

# Literature review

## Substantive representation

Substantive representation can be conceived as how elected representatives' actions align with the needs and wishes of their constituents [@pitkin1967]. Women MPs are often considered to be best positioned to represent the interests and needs of women, by raising policy issues of importance to women and/or by bringing women's perspectives to policy issues often considered more masculine, such as the economy. @krook2012 define and categorize the gendered nature of cabinet positions, suggesting that policy issues such as healthcare, social welfare, and gender equality are "women's issues," while more masculine-coded policy issues include the economy, defence, and foreign affairs. Neutral issues could include the environment, public works, and the civil service [@krook2012]. These categorizations are useful, but remain contested, especially as contemporary understandings of gender move beyond a binary framework. @vacaflores2025 suggests a solution to this by viewing policy issues along a spectrum of "feminized" and "masculinized" issues. This approach allows for a more flexible understanding of what counts as "women's issues" and who can represent women. Men MPs can also undertake the substantive representation of women [@mccallion2024] and issues not traditionally characterized as "women's issue" still hold gendered implications [@bird2005]. Nevertheless, issues such as gender-based violence, childcare, healthcare, social welfare, and education continue to be widely viewed as "women's issues" [@rayment2024; @krook2012].

Substantive representation in practice can take a number of forms in parliamentary contexts, including introducing legislation, engaging in debates, asking questions during QT, participating in committee meetings, or undertaking advocacy efforts [@mccallion2024; @childs2009]. However, routine parliamentary rules and procedures, such as interruptions and adversarial behaviour, can be mobilized to either contribute to or undermine women's substantive representation [@vallejo2022]. @vacaflores2025 finds that Private Members' Bills in the Australian House of Representatives, which are less constrained by party discipline, show that members' gender and individual backgrounds inform the types of issues addressed. Women MPs are more likely to speak to bills in parliament explicitly related to women's issues [@hargrave2021; @back2019], or provide a gendered lens even if the legislation does not specifically address issues traditionally characterized as "women's issues" [@rayment2024; @vacaflores2025].

Who raises these issues, and how they are framed in parliamentary speeches, is shaped by political party affiliation, ideology, and party discipline [@och2020; @tremblay2003; @childs2009]. In Canada, @rayment2024 illustrates that Conservative women MPs are more likely than Liberal and New Democratic Party (NDP) MPs to speak about "women's issues" between 1968 and 2015. However, Conservative MPs often focus on these issues through a traditional values lens, while Liberal and NDP MPs discuss these issues from a pro-gender equality perspective. This highlights that speaking and acting for women as part of substantive representation cannot be thought of in monolithic terms - party affiliation, ideology, and gender intersect, shaping how substantive representation occurs. In Australia, progressive parties such as the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Australian Greens more consistently support gender equity measures and address "women's issues," compared to right-leaning parties such as the Liberal Party of Australia [@vacaflores2025]. However, women MPs can work across party lines to advance "women's issues," as demonstrated by the successful effort to lift the ministerial veto on the importation of the abortion pill RU486 [@sawer2012]. <!-- Responses to legislation on domestic violence, paid parental leave, and the gender pay gap further reveal how different parties and MPs conceptualize and engage with "women's issues."--> These examples illustrate that while party affiliation and ideology can shape substantive representation, gender can, at times, exert stronger influence.

This engagement, however, does not take place in isolation, as broader institutional norms and rules shape how MPs speak and act on behalf of women's interests. One notable way these institutional norms manifest is through interruptions during parliamentary debates, which can either advance or hinder women MPs' ability to substantively represent women's interests. Interruptions do not only regulate who has access to speech and are "heard" more [@blumenau2021; @kathlene1994], but signal whose contributions are valued, highlighting how gendered power norms operate within parliamentary contexts [@broughton1999]. 

## Parliamentary culture and gender

Parliamentary culture and broader institutional norms play a critical role in shaping the conditions under which women MPs can speak and act on behalf of women's interests, institution often frame themselves as "neutral" [@collier2018]. This culture reflects and reproduces social hierarchies and power imbalances, rooted in gender, which intersect with race, sexuality, and class to shape political outcomes [@chappell2013]. In Westminster parliaments, including the Australian House of Representatives, masculine norms and values traditionally shaped parliamentary culture, constraining marginalized voices [@mackay2010; @crawford2011]. Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's 2012 sexism and misogyny speech drew global attention to these dynamics, highlighting how women MPs face a double bind as they "...negotiate the demand to demonstrate masculine leadership attributes without tarnishing the feminine qualities expected of them [@wright2014, p. 455; @sawer2013]. Parliamentary behaviour and interactions reflect this culture, shaping legislative debates and reinforcing gendered hierarchies that further marginalize women MPs. Understanding these gendered dimensions of parliamentary culture is therefore important for understanding how interruptions constrain women's substantive representation.

Feminist institutionalism provides a valuable framework for analyzing gendered dynamics within parliamentary settings, emphasizing how formal rules such as the Standing Orders and parliamentary privilege interact with informal rules and cultural norms [@kenny2014; @chappell2013; @mackay2010]. Although formal parliamentary rules aim to guarantee equality, informal norms often shape behaviours in unequal ways. For example, while Standing Orders intend to give women and men MPs equal speaking time, men are more likely to interrupt women MPs during their allocated time. @dowding2021 show in the Australian House of Representatives, speaking time depends on ministerial status, seniority, and gender, with women and less experienced MPs speaking less often despite the equal floor rules. As a result, women MPs may plan to give shorter speeches out of concern of being interrupted or abandon giving their speech entirely after being interrupted multiple times [@vallejo2022].

@hames2025 highlight that certain Standing Orders enshire unparliamentary language, while other language around discussions of social issues like racism rely on case-by-case rulings by the Speaker [@collier2018]. This ambiguity and lack of codified rules could further undermine women MPs attempting to speak on behalf of women and marginalized groups. As @ilie2010 argues, parliamentary discourse operates as a strategic interaction, structured by turn-taking, interruptions, and framing that reflect broader power hierarchies. These communicative practices are not neutral; they often amplify dominant voices and reinforce authority while undermining opponents [@ilie2013]. Furthermore, mechanisms such as parliamentary privilege, which shield MPs from the legal accountability for their speech in the chamber, often enable incivility and harassment that disproportionately affect women MPs [@collier2018; @sawer2013]. 

Feminist institutionalism therefore directs attention toward the "hidden" ways in which gender continues to shape participation, authority, and legitimacy within political institutions [@chappell2013]. At the same time, the growing descriptive representation of women can gradually reshape formal and informal norms, potentially altering discursive practices and reducing the frequency of gendered interruptions.  

## Interruptions and gender

Prior studies analyzing the gendered nature of interruptions in parliamentary debates and committee meetings globally show mixed results. Conceptually, interruptions operate as both interpersonal acts, shaped by relationships between members [@ilie2010; @ilie2013] and institutionalized practices embedded within parliamentary culture that function as strategic forms of political communication shaped by party affiliation and status [@diener2025]. This duality means that some interruptions are normalized and even institutionally sanctioned [@vallejo2022], while others serve as deliberate attempts to undermine and silence women MPs attempting to speak and act on behalf of women’s interests [@och2020; @kathlene1994]. Interruptions, therefore, can extend beyond procedural tactics to constitute a form of violence against women in politics (VAWIP). @krook2022 conceptualizes this as "semiotic violence," where language, symbols, and other discursive disruptions such as interruptions undermine women MPs' authority and presence. 

Within this broader conceptualization, empirical findings vary across parliaments. In the German Bundestag, @och2020 found that women MPs were interrupted more than men MPs, but argues that these interruptions did not necessarily count as semiotic VAWIP because women MPs learned to use strategically use interruptions to further their own goals. Similarly, @stopfner2018 employed qualitative case studies to understand whether gendered heckling stems from specific parliamentary contexts or reflects broader parliamentary culture. She concludes that both institutional norms and transnational parliamentary cultures contribute to the gendered interruptions that undermine women's process-oriented substantive representation [@rayment2024].

In the Ecuadorian Congress, @vallejo2022 found a more nuanced pattern, revealing that women Members of Congress were interrupted less frequently than men MPs, but interruptions silenced women at a higher rate. However, higher status and promotion to more prominent legislative roles could reverse some of the most negative effects of interruptions for women. In the Canadian House of Commons, @whyte2017 found that gendered interruptions sharply increased during the 1990s, coinciding with increasing descriptive representation of women. In contrast, @ash2025 found that women MPs in the German Bundestag receive more positive and fewer negative reactions to their speeches. Similarly, @vandijk2025 reveal no gender difference in the frequency of interruptions in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Croatia, and that the overall number of interruptions declined when more women participate in debates. Notably, they find that in Australia, the number of interruptions declined as the number of women serving in parliament increased.

Research focused on committee meetings further illustrates the gendered nature of interruptions. In the Australian Senate Estimate hearings between 2006 and 2015, @richards2016 finds that men senators used interruptions to block other speakers or assert control over the floor, with women senators and witnesses receiving the most negative interruptions. Likewise, in US state legislatures, @kathlene1994 shows that as the number of women increases in committee hearings, men legislators responded with more interruptions and verbal aggression aimed at undermining women's substantive participation in the policymaking process. Additionally, Miller and Sutherland found that women senators faced twice as many interruptions from male colleagues when speaking about "women's issues," with men senators employing an aggressive form of interruptions called "rapid-fire ‘interruption clusters'" to disrupt their speeches [-@miller2023, p. 103].

Taken together, these studies of both parliamentary debates and committee meetings emphasize that interruptions often function as a gendered constraint on women's participation. However, evidence across nations and institutional contexts is mixed. While some studies find that women are interrupted more frequently, other scholarship suggests that overall interruptions may decline as women's descriptive representation increases [@vandijk2025]. This variation highlights the importance of examining how institutional, contextual, and temporal factors, such as party affiliation and parliamentary norms shape the frequency and nature of interruptions. 

By focusing on interruptions in the Australian House of Representatives from 1998 to 2025, our paper contributes to this literature by combining feminist institutionalism with quantitative methods to examine how interruptions function as a gendered, but evolving constraint on women's substantive representation.

# Data and methods

## Dataset overview

To perform this analysis, we use a subset of the digitized Australian Hansard corpus produced by @katz2023. This dataset captures parliamentary proceedings in the House of Representatives. It was generated using the XML transcripts available on the Parliament of Australia website. The parsed XML transcripts were reshaped, cleaned, enhanced, and validated using a combination of manual and automated tests, as well as external datasets available in the `AustralianPoliticians` and `ausPH` R packages [@auspol; @leslie_ausph_2024].

Our dataset contains a total of 535,961 rows, where each row represents an individual statement, with details on who is speaking. For completeness, we analyze complete parliamentary periods. As a result, the earliest date is the first sitting day of parliament number 39 (10 November 1998), and the latest date is the final sitting day of parliament number 47 (27 March 2025). The cutoff dates used for each parliamentary period are available in the Appendix, in @tbl-parl_dates.

The use of data spanning multiple parliamentary periods allows us to explore patterns over time, which is of particular interest as the descriptive representation of women in the House of Representatives increased from 22 per cent in 1998 to 45 per cent in 2022 [@ABS2025; @IFES1998]. This period also includes Julia Gillard's tenure as Australia's first woman prime minister (2010 to 2013).

Our dataset only includes Chamber proceedings (i.e. it does not contain either the Federation Chamber or the Senate). Choosing to exclude rows from the Federation Chamber is motivated largely by: 1) not every sitting day has Federation Chamber proceedings, 2) these proceedings are often significantly shorter than the Chamber proceedings, and 3) the topics discussed in the Federation Chamber are restricted [@australia2018house]. As such, interjection data are far more sparse in the Federation Chamber proceedings, making it less suitable for this project.

As an example, @tbl-sample contains all rows of speech number 109 from the Hansard proceedings on 27 March 2025, followed by a list defining each variable as outlined in @katz2023. By looking at the first individual who makes a statement in that speech (i.e., the name associated with the minimum order number), we can identify the person whose turn it is to speak, which in @tbl-sample is Rob Mitchell. Therefore, any statements made by members within that speech that are not attributed to Rob Mitchell (the member whose turn it is to speak), the Speaker, or the Deputy Speaker, are flagged as interjections in the `interject` column [@katz2023].

```{r}

  select(-date) %>% 
  mutate(body = ifelse(str_count(body, "\\w+")>10, 
                       paste0(word(body, end=10), "..."), body)) %>% 
      mutate(gender = case_when(gender=="female" ~ "woman",
                              gender=="male" ~ "man",
                              .default = gender)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "") %>%

  kableExtra::column_spec(5, width = "7cm") %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(6:7, width="1cm")
```

The variables in @tbl-sample are:

-   `name`: Name of the individual speaking as parsed from the Hansard XML.
-   `order`: Row number
-   `speech_no`: Index of each speech made on the given sitting day, which includes all statements and interruptions
-   `partyName`: Speaking member's party name
-   `body`: Statement text
-   `gender`: Gender of the speaker
-   `interject`: Interjection flag

The value for gender was assigned only for rows with an individual MP's name in the `name` column. Rows with body text containing a business start or stage direction are attributed as such, and cannot be assigned a gender. Also, there are over 18,000 rows in the corpus attributed to one or multiple opposition members, government members, or honourable members, where no gender can be assigned. Other examples of statements which cannot be assigned a gender include those made by The Speaker, The Deputy Speaker, or The Acting Speaker. In all of these cases, the gender value is left as missing.

Interjections within parliamentary proceedings can take different forms [@wissik2021encoding; @vallejo2022]. They may be nonverbal in nature, such as laughter or applause, or they may be clearly spoken verbal interruptions. Further, interjections can be made by one specific individual, or they may be recorded more generally and attributed to a group such as government members. Interruptions may also be classified as either institutionalized or non-institutionalized. An example of an institutionalized interruption would be an announcement made by the elected Speaker, whereas a non-institutionalized interruption would be a comment made by an MP during someone else's speech. While some parliamentary transcripts for other countries such as Sweden explicitly differentiate between types of interjections within the transcript's encoding structure, this is not the case for the Australian Hansard XMLs [@wissik2021encoding]. As such, all interjections were parsed and processed in the same way for the entire corpus. This means that verbal and non-verbal interjections are categorized the same way, as are interjections made by one person and those made by a group. However, the interjection flagging method used by @katz2023 described in the previous paragraph specifically re-codes interruptions made by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker (i.e., institutionalized interjections) so that they are not flagged as interjections. As a result, this corpus focuses primarily on non-institutionalized interjections.

## Summary statistics

In our dataset there are a total of 1,651 sitting days, with 391 unique speakers, 9 unique parties, and 170 unique electorates. A summary of the number of sitting days per parliament is provided in @tbl-sitting-days. On average, there are 183 sitting days per parliament.

```{r}

read_csv("tables/n_sitting_days_per_parliament.csv", show_col_types = F) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "", align = 'l')
```

The number of unique speakers per day ranges from 1 to 116, with a mean and standard deviation of about 76 and 13, respectively. The number of speakers per day disaggregated by gender is illustrated in @fig-speakers-by-gender. Based on this plot it is clear that since 1998, the number of women speakers has overall been smaller than the number of men speakers. However, this gender gap appears to be narrowing over time, aligning with an increase in the descriptive representation of women MPs from 1998 to 2025.

![Number of unique speakers per day by gender](images/n_unique_speakers_per_day_gender.png){#fig-speakers-by-gender width="500"}

Of the 535,961 rows in this dataset, 95,522 are flagged as interjections, which amounts to about 18 per cent of the total row count. The distribution of interjections by gender is summarized in @tbl-interject-gender. The proportion of interjections made by men speakers is 53 per cent higher than that of women speakers. Also, 19 per cent of flagged interjections are associated with speakers without a specified gender (NA), most frequently attributed to "Opposition members," "Honourable members," or "Government members."

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Count and proportion of interjections by gender. Note: statements that were not made by an individual MP such as 'Government members interjecting-' could not be assigned a value for gender, resulting in a value of NA."

read_csv("tables/interject_by_gender.csv", show_col_types = F) %>% 
  mutate(Gender = case_when(Gender=="Female" ~ "Women",
                            Gender=="Male" ~ "Men",
                            .default = Gender)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "")
```

@fig-interject_day_gender illustrates the daily number of flagged interjections per speaker in parliament, with separate smoothed trend lines for men and women, accounting for differences in the number of men and women speakers present each day. Based on the smoothed trend lines, it appears that the daily rate of interjections for women MPs is generally lower than that of men MPs across sitting days. Despite an increase in the number of women MPs present over time as depicted in @fig-speakers-by-gender, the daily rate of interjections being made by women MPs does not appear to have increased as a result.

![Daily rate of interjections by gender](images/n_interject_per_day_gender.png){#fig-interject_day_gender width="500" fig-pos="H"}

@tbl-interject_by_party provides an overview of the interjections flagged by gender and political party. The values in the table capture the rate of interjections per MP for each gender and party. This rate is equal to the total number of interjections divided by the total number of unique MPs for the given gender and party. The percentages in parentheses represent the total share of interjections by gender in that party. For all five parties with both men and women MPs, the rate and share of interjections for men is notably higher than those of women.

read_csv("tables/interject_by_gender_and_party.csv", show_col_types = F) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "", digits = 0)
```

Finally, @tbl-speech_stats contains key metrics relating to the length of speeches in the corpus. The range of speech length is quite large, spanning from 1 word to 117,296 words. Examples of speeches with very small word counts are stage directions such as "Bill presented by Mr Tollner." (on 16 June 2003), or one-word answers to questions in writing such as "Yes" or "No." The average word count per speech across the entire corpus is about 639, with a standard deviation of about 1,080 words.

```{r}

#| label: tbl-speech_stats

read_csv("tables/speech_length_stats.csv", show_col_types = F) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "", digits = 0)
```

## Analysis dataset

To prepare the data for our purposes, some reshaping and filtering was necessary. Firstly, rows with a missing `speech_no` value were removed, since this variable is essential for preparing the data for modeling. We identified that the only rows which had a missing `speech_no` were stage directions, business starts, and questions in writing. There were no interjections associated with rows with a missing speech number, so filtering them out is unlikely to meaningfully affect the analysis. A new variable called `parliament_num` was then added to the corpus so that the correct parliament number associated with each sitting day was available, and could be used as a fixed effect in the model. <!-- TODO: add something about how we fixed the parties of Griggs, Tollner, Crook and Littleproud -->

Based on the model design, detailed in the next section, the input data must have one row for every MP per parliament, with their party affiliation, gender, number of interruptions received (outcome), and the number of speaking turns (offset). For the offset, we count each row within a given speech separately as a speaking turn. For example, in @tbl-sample-speech-2, it is Craig Emerson's turn to speak, and during this speech he was interrupted five times. After making his first statement, he was interrupted by both Bronwyn Bishop and Government members. Once the Speaker called "Order!" and he continued speaking, he was interrupted by Luke Simpkins. The Speaker spoke again, and then Craig Emerson spoke for the third time, after which he was interrupted by Opposition members, and finally the Speaker gave the floor to the Manager of Opposition Business to begin a new speech. Although this all happened within a single speech in which Craig Emerson had the floor, it contributes three units (i.e., speaking turns) to the offset because there were three separate instances in which Craig Emerson had a speaking turn and could be interrupted. This would also contribute five units (i.e., interjections) to the outcome count, because Craig Emerson was interrupted five times during this speech.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "All rows of speech number 74 from 12 February 2014"
#| tbl-cap-location: bottom 
#| label: tbl-sample-speech-2

read_csv("tables/corpus_sample_speaking_turns.csv", show_col_types = F) %>% 
  select(-date) %>% 
  mutate(body = ifelse(str_count(body, "\\w+")>10, 
                       paste0(word(body, end=10), "..."), body)) %>% 
    mutate(gender = case_when(gender=="female" ~ "woman",
                              gender=="male" ~ "man",
                              .default = gender)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    latex_options = c("scale_down"),
    font_size = 8) %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, width = "3cm") %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(2, width="1cm") %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(3, width="1.5cm") %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(4, width = "2.5cm") %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(5, width = "7cm") %>% 
  kableExtra::column_spec(6:7, width="1cm")
```

To prepare the model input data, the number of speaking turns was first computed using the logic described above. For each speech in the corpus, the MP whose turn it was to speak was identified as the individual with the smallest order number. Only rows corresponding to that MP were retained for each speech, and the total number of statements per MP, parliament, and party affiliation were then counted. This produced a dataframe with each MP's name, parliament number, party affiliation, and number of speaking turns.

The number of interjections made towards each MP was calculated by first identifying the MP whose turn it was to speak for each speech, as previously described. Then, rows corresponding to statements made by other MPs that were flagged as interjections were retained. The remaining rows were then used to count the total number of interjections received per MP, parliament, and party. This data table was then merged with the table of speaking turns, and any MPs with no recorded interjections in the corpus were assigned a value of zero.

It is possible for an MP to change political parties within a single parliamentary period. In those cases, there is a separate row in the input data for each party affiliation. For example, Julia Banks quit the Liberal Party of Australia and became an independent on 27 November 2018, during the forty-fifth parliament [@aus_handbook]. As such, the number of speaking turns and interjections received were counted separately for each combination of party and parliament number. Finally, the gender of each MP was added to the input table using the `gender` variable in the corpus. The first 15 rows of the resulting dataset are shown below in @tbl-model-df.

## Statistical model

### Model overview

This project explores how a given MP's gender and political party affiliation impact the frequency of interruptions made toward them while it is their turn to speak. We use a Negative Binomial model to perform this analysis, where the outcome $\mu_i$ represents the expected count of interruptions made toward an individual MP ($i$) within a given parliament.

We chose this model because it is well suited for modeling count outcome variables, such as the number of interjections. While a Poisson model is also suitable for count outcomes, it assumes that all observations for a given set of predictors share one underlying rate, equal to both the mean and the variance, which does not hold in the data at hand. In this setting, the Poisson model assumes one rate of interruptions for all MPs with a given combination of values for parliament number, gender, and political party, and that any other variation observed is due solely to randomness. This assumption is not reasonable here because there are sources of variance that cannot be observed which influence the rate at which an MP is interrupted, such as speaking style or personality [@hargrave2022; @ilie2013]. For example, an MP who is aggressive or harsh would likely get interrupted more frequently than one who is not aggressive [@blumenau2021; @kathlene1994]. Since these sources of heterogeneity cannot be observed, the amount of variation present in the data will be higher than what would be expected under the Poisson model, and the assumption of an equal mean and variance will be violated. This situation is referred to as overdispersion.

One way to check for overdispersion is by comparing the residual deviance of a model to it's degrees of freedom. If the model and assumed variance structure are a good fit for the data, then these two values should be approximately equal (i.e., ratio of $\approx 1$) [@roback2021beyond]. To validate our choice to use a Negative Binomial model instead of a Poisson model, we compared the ratio of residual deviance and degrees of freedom in both models. Under the Poisson model, this value is $\approx 18.7$, indicating major overdispersion. In contrast, under the Negative Binomial model, this value is $\approx 1.01$, which is indicative of a better model fit. Over-dispersion is not an issue in the Negative Binomial case because the variance structure of the model accounts for it by including a dispersion parameter $\theta$, which allows the variance to exceed the mean, thereby accounting for unobserved sources of variation. This leads to an improved model fit and more reliable estimates.

Following @rayment2024, the model has parliament-fixed effects to capture contextual changes between parliaments, as well as an offset for the number of times it was an MP's turn to speak, to account for the fact that an MP who gives more speeches has more opportunities to be interrupted. This model design allows us to predict the number of interruptions that will be directed towards an MP with a certain set of characteristics in a single parliament period.

### Model notation

The model is denoted as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i &\sim \text{Negative Binomial}(\mu_i, \theta) \\
\log(\mu_i) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Woman}_i  + \sum_{k=1}^8 \beta_k \text{Parliament}_{ki}+ \sum_{j=1}^{8} \beta_j \text{Party}_{ji} + \log(S_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

where

-   $\mu_i$ is a count of the expected number of interruptions for MP $i$
-   $\theta$ is the dispersion parameter
-   $\text{Woman}_i$ is a dummy variable equal to $1$ if MP $i$ is a woman, and $0$ otherwise
-   $\text{Parliament}_{ki}$ is a dummy variable equal to $1$ if MP $i$ is part of parliament $k$, and $0$ otherwise. There are 9 unique parliamentary periods in the corpus, and the sum ranges from $1$ to $8$ because the $9^{th}$ acts as the reference category
-   $\text{Party}_{ji}$ is a categorical variable that reflects the party $j$ that MP $i$ is a member of in the specified parliament. There are 9 unique party affiliations in the corpus, and the sum ranges from $1$ to $8$ because the $9^{th}$ acts as the reference category
-   $\log(\text{S}_i)$ is the offset term for the number of speaking turns had by MP $i$

We performed this analysis using R Statistical Software, version 4.3.3 [@r]. After preparing the model input data, the `glm.nb` function from the `MASS` package was used to fit a Negative Binomial regression model with a log link function, as defined in the previous section [@MASS]. The parliament number, party abbreviation, and gender variables were coded as factors to ensure they were correctly interpreted as categorical variables in the model.

# Analysis and results

The results from our model, including coefficients, exponentiated coefficients (i.e., rate ratios), and p-values are summarized in @tbl-model-coeffs. @tbl-parties in the Appendix provides the full party name associated with each abbreviation. This model output has a total of 18 coefficients: 1 intercept coefficient, 8 parliament number coefficients where the reference category is parliament number 47, 8 party coefficients where the reference category is ALP (Australian Labor Party), and 1 coefficient for the woman variable. Since the outcome of the Negative Binomial model is on the log scale, exponentiating the coefficient values yields rate ratios which are easier to interpret. For categorical variables, rate ratios capture the multiplicative effect of a variable on the expected count of interjections, relative to it's reference category. A rate ratio which is greater than 1 implies that the expected count of interjections is higher than the reference category, and a rate ratio less than 1 indicates that the expected count of interjections is lower than the reference category. This effect can also be expressed in terms of percentages. For instance, a rate ratio of 0.75 corresponds to a 25 per cent lower expected count compared to the reference category, while a rate ratio of 1.30 corresponds to a 30 per cent higher expected count compared to the reference category.

model_output <- readRDS("model/model_results.rds")

broom::tidy(model_output) %>%
  mutate(odds_ratio = exp(estimate)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(term, estimate, odds_ratio, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(across(c(estimate, odds_ratio, p.value), ~round(.x, 3))) %>%
  rename(Term=term, `Regression Coefficient`=estimate, `Rate Ratio`=odds_ratio, `P-value`=p.value) %>% 
  mutate(Term = ifelse(Term=="genderfemale", "genderWoman", Term)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "")
```

The `parliament_num` coefficients capture how the expected number of interjections in one parliament compares to that in the 47th parliament (the reference category), holding gender and party affiliation constant. Since the rate ratio for the 39th parliament is $\approx$ 1.5, this indicates that MPs in 39th parliament are expected to be interrupted 1.5 times (or 50 per cent) more than MPs in the 47th parliament. In contrast, this output tells us that an MP in the 46th parliament is expected to be interrupted about 32.4 per cent times less than an MP in the 47th parliament (Rate Ratio = 0.676). Interestingly, the rate ratios for earlier parliaments (i.e., 39 through 44) are all greater than 1, while the rate ratios for later parliaments (i.e., 45 and 46) are less than 1. This suggests temporal and contextual changes in the frequency of being interrupted [@kenny2014], holding gender and party affiliation constant. The p-value column indicates that the coefficients for the 39th, 40th, 41st, 42nd, and 46th parliaments are statistically significant at the level of 0.05.

The estimated rate ratios for `party` range from 0.172 for NXT to 1.062 for PUP. The only party with rate ratio greater than 1 is PUP, however this coefficient is not statistically significant (p $\approx$ 0.92). This suggests that after controlling for gender and parliament, MPs from PUP are not significantly more likely to be interrupted than those from the reference category party (ALP). 

For the other 7 parties, the rate ratios are below 1, indicating a lower expected number of interjections compared to MPs in ALP, holding gender and parliament constant. Among these, the coefficients for CA, IND, and NXT are statistically significant (p < 0.05). For example, the estimated rate ratio for IND is 0.639, implying that an Independent MP is expected to experience about 36 per cent fewer interruptions than an MP in the Australian Labor Party, controlling for gender and parliament.

Finally, the `gender` rate ratio indicates that a woman MP is expected to be interrupted about 26.8 per cent less than a man MP holding party and parliament constant. The associated p-value ($\approx 0$) implies that this effect is highly significant.

# Conclusion

This study employed quantitative analysis to examine how MPs’ gender and political party affiliation shape the frequency of interruptions made toward them during their speaking turn in the Australian House of Representatives and to understand implications for women MPs’ substantive representation. To do so, we utilize a dataset of digitized Hansard transcripts covering the 39th to 47th parliaments (November 1998 to March 2025). Our results point to three main findings. First, we found that women MPs were less likely to be interrupted than men MPs, when controlling for the number of speeches MPs give in each parliament. Next, we found that MPs affiliated with the Liberal Party of Australia, The Nationals, and the Australian Greens were less likely to be interrupted in comparison to the Australian Labor Party. Lastly, we confirm that parliamentary context, including party affiliation and discipline, and the numerical presence of women MPs shape the frequency of interruptions. Earlier parliaments in our dataset (39th and 40th) witnessed more interruptions overall than recent parliaments (46th and 47th) where the number of women elected to the House of Representatives rose from about 20 per cent to around 40 per cent. These results suggest that increasing the number of women elected to parliament impacts the overall workplace dynamics and culture, helping to overcome some of the formal and informal gendered rules and norms that historically shaped women MPs’ experiences in Westminster parliaments [@sawer2013; @mackay2010; @chappell2013].

There are several limitations and areas for future research. While the digitized Hansard transcripts provided detailed insight into parliamentary debates and QT, they do not fully capture all discourse and interactions between members. This is due to editorial decisions made by the Hansard reporters to not include select interruptions or heckles or the House voted to expunge certain language, debates, or interactions from the official record [@feldman2023]. Likewise, related discursive practices and aggressive behaviours can happen off camera in the Chamber or in the hallways around parliament, not being recorded by official records, but still undermining women MPs’ substantive representation [@collier2018; @crawford2011]. 

Future studies could employ qualitative analysis alongside quantitative analysis to highlight contexts that are more likely to lead to interruptions and to better understand the nature of language MPs use when interjecting. Additionally, future studies could focus on evaluating the types of issues raised in speeches to better understand how interruptions limit women MPs’ abilities to speak and act on behalf of women's interests [@krook2012; @mccallion2024]. Lastly, focusing on differentiating between types of interruptions and their impacts on parliamentary discourse and substantive representation could be a focus of future studies [@wissik2021encoding; @vallejo2022].

By focusing on the Australian House of Representatives, we contribute to the substantive representation literature which typically focuses on North America and Europe [@vacaflores2025]. Our research confirms that gender shapes the nature and frequency of interruptions in the House of Representatives, demonstrating that electing more women can positively influence institutional norms and culture. This underscores the importance of continuing to advance gender equality in politics to ensure better policy outcomes for all citizens.
